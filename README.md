# Chess

A simple JavaFX chess app, primarily developed to work in LAN (one server and multiple clients). The project is yet to be continued.  

Areas to develop:  

- add chess logic locally - originally the logic was supposed to be implemented on server side
- implement AI to allow playing offline against a bot
- migrate the server from C to Java
